# üï∑Ô∏è Quadruped Spider Robot

This project is a **four-legged (quadruped) robot** designed to mimic the natural movement of a spider.  
The robot uses an **Arduino microcontroller** to control its **servo motors** and move efficiently, while integrated sensors help with obstacle detection and environmental interaction.

### ‚ú® Features
- Simulates **natural spider-like locomotion** (walk, turn, rotate).  
- **Obstacle detection** using ultrasonic/IR sensors for safe navigation.  
- Modular Arduino code for easy control and future expansions.  
- Lightweight and compact design with custom 3D-printed or fabricated parts.  

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Arduino UNO/MEGA, Servo Motors (4‚Äì8 depending on legs), Ultrasonic/IR sensors, Custom frame (3D-printed/PCB-supported)  
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, C/C++  
- **Control**: Pre-programmed movement sequences; potential for manual/remote control  

### üìå Applications
- Educational platform for learning robotics and kinematics.  
- Demonstrates gait algorithms for multi-legged robots.  
- Research prototype for advanced robotics and AI integration.  
- Hobbyist and maker projects exploring bio-inspired locomotion.
